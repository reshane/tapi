# tapi
torch api - named in a hurry

## quick start
```
don't
```
...

`$cargo r`

## what is happening
this is a rocket api that loads the resnet18 model every time the root `"/"` is hit and it makes a prediction on the same image.
it then returns a string containing the prediction and probability.
kind of useless, but for now it's a proof of concept.
